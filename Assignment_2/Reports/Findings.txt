==Random Sample==
For the random sample of Glucose, the Max and Mean of the Sample were quite close to these metrics for the overall Population.
This isn't always the case, but this random sample seemed to be indicative of the larger dataset.
It is worth noting that the random sample had a smaller overall spread, despite being a smaller dataset.
This clustering may be indicative of most values being clustered around the mean, with occasional samples in the larger population pushing the bounds.

==Percentile==
The 98th percentile of the BMI data was again, quite similar to the overall population.
The chart of the data showed a distribution which was remarkably similar to the population as a whole.

==Bootstrap==
The bootstrap method provides a simple method to obtain a surprisingly accurate mean that is very close to the mean of the population.
This is evidence of the central limit theorem, where for standard distribution data centralizes around the mean.
Notably, the standard deviation for the bootstrap differs significantly from the population.
This tight grouping suggests that the majority of the data is clustered around the mean.
